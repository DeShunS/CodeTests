## DevOps Code Assessment
The Marketing team is building a new site from scratch. A Marketing Manager has used Wordpress in the past, and wants a sandbox to play in. She is going to start experimenting with various themes and content. Eventually, once she has Wordpress configured the way she wants, she'll be ready to talk to you about getting the Wordpress site promoted to production.

1. Describe what you think you need to do to get a Wordpress server into her hands as quickly as reasonably possible.
1. Using automation, do what you described in Question 1.
1. What additional steps would you plan on doing once the Marketing Manager says she's ready for the site to be in production. What tools would you use to accomplish those steps?

Notes:
1. We will be running the provisioning script on MacBook Pros.
