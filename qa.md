1. SignalPath is getting a new vending machine. Describe how you would go about testing it.
1. Create four test cases for Twitter's authentication functionality.
1. Suppose you have a web site with two form elements on it: a multi-line textarea and button that says "multiply". The expected behavior is that when you click "multiply" all of the numbers written in the textarea are multiplied together and written next to the textarea. For instance, if the textarea has the numbers 5, 7, 11 then the output will be 385. Identify all the test cases that you would need to write. (You do not actually need to write the detailed steps for every test case, just the summary.)
