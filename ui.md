1. Choose one of the following coding exercises.
 - Using [this SpaceX API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API), create an Angular application that shows a list of SpaceX launches in a sortable (by launch order) grid. The user should be able to page through the results. The columns of the grid should be Flight Number, Launch Year, Rocket Name, and Details. For a given launch, the user should be able to click on the row to navigate to the presskit for that launch using the url provided in the API response.
 - Extend the popular [Angular ToDo MVC](http://todomvc.com/examples/angularjs/#/) such that an entry (to do) can be assigned a priority (high, medium, low).  Upon completion of an entry (to do) the user may optionally provide a date on which the entry was completed.
