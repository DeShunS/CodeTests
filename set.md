## Software Engineering in Test Code Assessment

1. Using any tool of your choice, create two test cases for Twitter's log-in functionality.
1. Using any tool of your choice, create an automated test for one of the two test cases from problem 2.
1. Suppose you have a web site with two form elements on it: a multi-line textarea and button that says "multiply". The expected behavior is that when you click "multiply" all of the numbers written in the textarea are multiplied together and written next to the textarea. For instance, if the textarea has the numbers 5, 7, 11 then the output will be 385. Identify all the test cases that you would need to write. (You do not actually need to write the detailed steps for every test case, just the summary. For instance, one of your test cases might read: "5 x 7 x 11 = 385")
